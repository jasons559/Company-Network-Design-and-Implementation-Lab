<h1>Enterprise Network Design+Implementation Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this project, I designed an enterprise network for a trading floor support center. The network design connects six departments,across three floors within the buildng. Each floor consists of two departments, with 120 expected users per department. The goal of this project, was to design a hierarchical network model, to meet current business needs, as well as future expansion, incorporating redundancy at each layer.</p> 

<b>Network components include:</b>6 multi-layer switches, 2 routers,and 2 ISPS.

<b>End devices include:</b>PCs, printers, laptops, and printers with wireless connection capabilitiies.  

Configured basic settings for all intermediary and end devices, such as hostname assignment, password enabling, banner messaging, and IP domain lookup disabling.

Created subnets, performed IP address and VLAN assignment, configured inter-VLAN routing with access and port trunking Additional configurations implemented include: switchport security, SSH and OSPF routing protocol, wireless network and DHCP server configuration, port address translation (PAT), and access control lists
